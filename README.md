# trustpilot-scraper

Minimal Python scraper to download reviews from Trustpilot per rating (1-5 star system) for all companies in all categories from Trustpilot.

Fully functional but sparsely documentet during the summer of 2023 but no promises are made going forward. Follow the print statements for modification and debugging. Some throttling is implemented and could probably be decreased for better run time.

Initially created to complete a sentiment analysis modelling dataset (ScandiSent) with neutral examples, represented by 3 star ratings, in order to create a multi-class sentiment model (neg/neu/pos).
